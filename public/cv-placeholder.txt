CV Placeholder

This is a placeholder for your CV file. 

To use the CV button:

1. Upload your CV PDF to the public folder and name it 'cv.pdf'
2. OR add your CV URL to the site_settings table in Supabase:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to Table Editor > site_settings
   - Add your CV URL to the cv_url field

The button will automatically use the CV URL from Supabase if available, otherwise it will fall back to /cv.pdf in the public folder.
